# myHadoop

A. My Apache-Spark projects and some use cases:
  1. Folders (except 'ml-100k', 'nc111nt') contain different source codes (within the .../src/... folders).
  2. Datasets/files & 'ml-100k' folder, specific jar files, etc. are kept under 'myHadoop' repo, under the /home directory of myHadoop.
  3. 'nc111nt' folder & 'access_log.txt' file kept within the same folder; they are to create streaming data for the programmes 'LogAlarmer.scala', 'LogParser.scala', 'LogSQL.scala' inside the 'myHadoop/SparkStreamingProgs' folder.  The steps to execute are explained in the comments within the programme 'LogAlarmer.scala'.
